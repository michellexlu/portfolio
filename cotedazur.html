                        <p>The Côte d'Azur (or French Riviera) will always hold a special place in my heart as the only place I have ever lived outside of the 
                            United States. I spent a semester abroad in this quaint coastal town just on the outskirts of Nice called Antibes. I had 
                            been studying French for 10 years prior, and I felt that the best way to achieve true fluency in the language 
                            would be to immerse myself directly in a small town of the native-speaking country. During my short-lived time there (thanks to COVID-19), 
                            I accomplished my goal of strengthening my conversational French skills while creating lasting friendships and making memories 
                            of a lifetime.

                        <h5 class="france_mustdos">ANTIBES</h5>
                        <p>After living in this beautiful town for a little over 2 months, it had to be first on my list. Although you can generally expect a peaceful, more 
                            relaxing visit to Antibes, there are, nonetheless, endless activities to do and things to see. 
                            <br>
                            <br>If you visit in the summertime, the 
                            beaches and narrow cobblestone streets will be swamped with visitors from all over the world, while the ports will be full of luxury yachts. It is 
                            located right in between Nice and Cannes, serving as a laid-back vacation getaway from those larger cities. 
                            <br>
                            <br>On the other hand, I had the opportunity 
                            to experience Antibes during its winter season, which is much quieter with minimal tourists. The only real downside of visiting during 
                            the off-season was that some shops and restaurants had shorter opening hours. However, the serene ambiance and authentic experience of living among the locals 
                            made this small inconvenience completely worth it. The weather also remained relatively warm (at least in my Bostonian opinion), staying mostly in the 
                            high 50s throughout January-March.

                                    lived up to our expectations. I ordered escargot as an appetizer and the fish of the day as my entrée– both 
                                    were delicious but be prepared to break the bank at this restaurant.

                        <h5 class="france_mustdos">NICE</h5>
                        <p>I definitely didn't get to spend as much time as I would've liked to in Nice during my time in the French 
                            Riviera, but the few short visits I made were enough to make me fall in love with the city. 
                            <br><br>
                            As the largest city in the region, it's definitely more lively than its charming neighbor Antibes. Nice is famous for its 
                            stunning coastline, as well as its alluring art and culture with an abundance of museums, festivals, and beautiful architecture 
                            around every corner.
                            <br><br>
                            The other thing I love about Nice is how easy it is to get to other stops along the Riviera. From the city, it was only a short bus 
                            ride back to Antibes and a quick train ride to Cannes, Monaco, and other coastal towns that I highly recommend visiting if you have 
                            the time (like Villefranche-sur-Mer).

                                    market that sells fresh produce. The Nice airport and La Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nice (Museum of Fine Arts) lie at the other end.

                                    We spent most of our time wandering through the cobblestone streets to make our way to the top of the hill. We also toured 
                                    the famous perfume factory in Eze (Parfumerie Galimard), which was the perfect place to pick up some gifts to bring back home.

                        <p>This small town is nicknamed "the Pearl of France," and once I arrived, I could see why. I immediately fell in love with the rainbow colored 
                            buildings perched high atop the hill and stunning views of the Mediterranean. After a day of touring the Italian Riviera, my program stopped here 
                            on our way back to Antibes and made it just in time to catch the sunrise, which casted a warm, glowing light over the entire town. It was definitely 
                            one of the most beautiful sights I had ever seen.
                            <br><br>
                            Menton is smaller and less touristy than Nice and Cannes, offerering a serene alternative with just as much to see and do. It's the last train stop along  
                            the Cote d'Azur before hitting the Italian border, making it an easy day trip to make from any of the other larger cities. Menton is known for 
                            its abundance of lemon trees, lovely gardens, colorful old town, and pleasant year-round climate.

                                        restaurants. It serves upscale French cuisine with a little bit of Italian influence, as the town sits so close to the border of Italy. Be sure to plan ahead though
                                        (I'm talking like months ahead), since securing a reservation at this high-class restaurant is a challenging feat.

                        <p>Unfortunately, I didn't get to spend much time in Cannes. I mostly went into the city to enjoy its bustling nightlife, but I would've 
                            loved to explore more of the area during the day. Cannes is known as a hotspot for the rich and famous, which makes sense from all of the 
                            high-end stores and trendy restaurants/bars around the city. I'm sure you've also probably heard of the Cannes Film Festival, which is hosted at the 
                            Palais des Festivals et des Congrès.
                            <br><br>
                            Since I didn't get to go to these places myself, the list of activities below are recommended must-dos from friends and locals. Hopefully 
                            others will be able to enjoy them instead, and I'm determined to eventually make my way back!

                        <p>As a huge foodie, I spent a lot of my time in France trying new foods and enjoying the local cuisine. So of course, I had 
                            to dedicate a section to recommend some of my favorite cafés, bakeries, and restaurants. Since Antibes was my home base, 
                            most of these places are found there.
