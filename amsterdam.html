                            Amsterdam definitely makes it on my list of top 5 all-time favorite destinations. The unconventional culture of Amsterdam, coupled with its 
                            natural beauty and contemporary architectural style, has me seriously considering moving there someday. 
                            <br><br>
                            Often referred to as the "Venice of the North," the city is most famous for its canals that are constructed in a unique radial structure around the city center. 
                            Right at the center of the canals is where you will find Dam Square, which stems off into multiple popular streets full of shops and 
                            restaurants. During my weekend trip to this spirited Dutch city, I indulged in delectable foods and one-of-a-kind experiences.

                                    the central point of the city.

                                <div class="mustdos_p"><p>The <strong>Moco Museum</strong> is every street art lover's dream. It showcases works by famous modern artists like Banksy and incorporates 
                                a captivating interactive art exhibition that makes for the perfect Instagram-worthy photo spot.<br>
                                <br>
                                While <strong>Rijksmuseum</strong> might be a mouthful to say, it is one of the most famous museums in the world. It captures over 800 years of 
                                Dutch history with about 8000 pieces of art on display. Tourists from all over the world flock to this museum in particular to see The Night 
                                Watch by Rembrandt.<br>
                                </p></div>

                                <li>Set sail on a cruise through the canals of Amsterdam</li>
                                <div class="mustdos_p"><p>The best way to see all the hidden corners of Amsterdam is by way of boat. There are 165 canals running through the city– each a little different from the next. 
                                I had a great experience booking a shared cruise boat with some friends, as it included food and drinks, as well as a guide who helped explain the history and sights. 
                                We also had the cool opportunity to meet other tourists who joined us on the tour.

                                <li>Try some Amsterdam food favorites</li>
                                <div class="mustdos_p"><p>You can't leave Amsterdam without trying a few of their famous local treats! My favorites were the stroopwaffels (thin wafers with syrup filling on the inside) and 
                                poffertjes (mini pancakes, as pictured above). Both of these often come with a variety of toppings of your choice- personally, I recommend adding strawberries, 
                                bananas, and nutella to your poffertjes; it was to die for! The best part is that you won't have to look hard to find these delicacies, since street vendors 
                                and restaurants sell them all over the city.
                                </p></div>

                                <div class="mustdos_p"><p>I'm sure when you picture Amsterdam, if you're not thinking of canals, you're most likely envisioning the city populated by bikers. Bicycling is recommended as the 
                                easiest and most efficient form of transportation around the city. Biking is a significant part of daily life for residents, but if you happen to visit for a quick trip, 
                                renting a bike to see the city is a must-do. A fun fact that I learned during my canal tour is that 12,000-15,000 bicycles are pulled out of the canals each year!
                                </p></div>

                                <li>Visit the Anne Frank House</li>
                                <div class="mustdos_p"><p>The Anne Frank House is another famous destination in Amsterdam. This museum tells the devastating story of Anne Frank by allowing visitors to read her diary and view the 
                                Secret Annex where she and her family hid during World War II. For many, it is quite an emotional experience to see some of the real artifacts that Anne Frank had written 
                                about in her diary. The museum is also located in the charming Jordaan district, which I highly recommend walking around if you're in the area.

                            The restaurants in Amsterdam definitely matched the eclectic vibe of the city itself. We hit lots of trendy and unique places during our weekend trip, and I've documented 
                            them all below, including a few that I didn't get a chance to check out myself. Traditional dutch food also did not disappoint– we loved all of the 
                            new foods we tried!
