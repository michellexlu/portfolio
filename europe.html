            <p>Europe has always been my family's go-to travel destination. I'm forever grateful to my parents for 
                bringing my brother and I along on their wordly travels from a young age and instilling in us a 
                passion for European culture as deep as theirs. Traveling in Europe accomodates the best of both worlds 
                in terms of those looking to splurge on a luxurious trip, as well as those looking to travel on a budget. 
                There is deep-rooted history all around you in Europe, buried in the art, architecture, and even in the streets, 
                telling fascinating stories about the past and leaving you feeling a sense of enlightenment. Not to mention, 
                I've had, without a doubt, the best meals of my life in Europe. You're guaranteed to leave with a happy soul 
                and happy stomach. Below, I've written about a few of my favorite European cities, including must-try foods, 
                itineraries, and travel tips.

                <p>The Côte d'Azur (or French Riviera) will always hold a special place in my heart as the only place I have ever lived outside of the 
                United States. I spent a semester abroad in a quaint coastal town just on the outskirts of Nice called Antibes. I had 
                been studying French for 10 years prior, and I felt that the best way to achieve true fluency in the language 
                would be to immerse myself directly in a small town of the native-speaking country. During my short-lived time there (thanks to COVID-19), 
                I accomplished my goal of strengthening my conversational French skills while creating lasting friendships and making memories 
                of a lifetime.

                    Budapest, Hungary is one of the few places I've been fortunate enough to travel to twice in my life. I first discovered the beautiful 
                    city in 2015 when I took a family trip there in the summertime. The second time was about 5 years later during my study abroad experience 
                    in the wintertime, which showed me a completely different side of the city. It was as if I was visiting for the first time all over again. 
                    Budapest is famous for its long-standing history, mesmerizing architecture, natural hot springs, and dyanimc night-life– all for a cheap price! The locals are 
                    all friendly and welcoming, especially in comparison to those in other European countries.

                    Amsterdam definitely makes it on my list of top 5 all-time favorite destinations. The unconventional culture of Amsterdam, coupled with its 
                    natural beauty and contemporary architectural style, has me seriously considering moving there someday. Often referred to as the 
                    "Venice of the North," the city is most famous for its canals that are constructed in a unique radial structure around the city center. 
                    Right at the center of the canals is where you will find Dam Square, which stems off into multiple popular streets full of shops and 
                    restaurants. During my weekend trip to this spirited Dutch city, I indulged in delectable foods and one-of-a-kind experiences.

                            <p>The best way to see all the hidden corners of Amsterdam is by way of boat. There are 165 canals running through the city– each a little different from the next. 
                                I had a great experience booking a shared cruise boat with some friends, as it included food and drinks, as well as a guide who helped explain the history and sights. 
                                We also had the cool opportunity to meet other tourists who joined us on the tour.

                        <li>Try some Amsterdam food favorites</li>
                            <p>You can't leave Amsterdam without trying a few of their famous local treats! My favorites were the stroopwaffels (thin wafers with syrup filling on the inside) and 
                                poffertjes (mini pancakes, as pictured above). Both of these often come with a variety of toppings of your choice- personally, I recommend adding strawberries, 
                                bananas, and nutella to your poffertjes; they were to die for! The best part is that you won't have to look hard to find these delicacies, since street vendors 
                                and restaurants sell them all over the city.

                            <p>I'm sure when you picture Amsterdam, if you're not thinking of canals, you're most likely envisioning the city populated by bikers. Bicycling is recommended as the 
                                easiest and most efficient form of transportation around the city. Biking is a significant part of daily life for residents, but if you happen to visit for a quick trip, 
                                renting a bike to see the city is a must-do. A fun fact that I learned during my canal tour is that 12,000-15,000 bicycles are pulled out of the canals each year!

                            <p>The Anne Frank House is another famous destination in Amsterdam. This museum tells the devastating story of Anne Frank by allowing visitors to read her diary and view the 
                                Secret Annex where she and her family hid during World War II. For many, it is quite an emotional experience to see some of the real artifacts that Anne Frank had written 
                                about in her diary. The museum is also located in the charming Jordaan district, which I highly recommend walking around if you're in the area.

                    I can wholeheartedly confirm that Venice is just as magical as it looks in all the movies and photos. It is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever laid eyes on.
                    Tourists mainly visit for the canals that function in place of roads throughout the city, since the entire region is built on water. The blue water of the Adriatic Sea 
                    contrasted with the red roofs of the buildings paint a picturesque view that seems to have come straight out of a storybook. Prepare for a diet consisting mostly 
                    of pizza, pasta, and gelato, but don't worry! There are so many attractions to see that all of the walking you'll be doing around the city will work the food right off 
                    (plus it tastes so good that it's more than worth it).

                    Every travel agency website is bound to display an image of the iconic blue-domed, white-wallled villages of the Greek islands. 
                    If a chance to see this spectacular scenery in person isn't enough of a reason to make a trip, then the food and beaches will 
                    surely convince you. I've had the chance to visit Mykonos and Santorini, which are the 2 most popular islands among the hundreds 
                    of inhabited islands belonging to Greece. While the two share many physical similarities, they radiate completely different 
                    ambiances. Mykonos is famous for its upbeat and upscale scene; whereas, Santorini has a more relaxed and romantic atmosphere. 
                    I'm beyond grateful for having had the opportunity to get a taste of both the rowdy and serene sides to the Greek islands.

                        <li>Go island hopping from Mykonos to the nearby Cycladic islands.</li>
                            <p>The central location of Mykonos makes it the perfect starting point for a day of island-hopping to see some of the smaller Greek 
                                islands. We ended up staying on one of the islands and renting a beach cabana for the day- so relaxing!

                            <p>Sitting at the top of Oia Castle and watching the sunset was a surreal moment for me. The orange and pink skies complimented the whitewashed

                                suggest getting there early to secure a good spot.

                                to taste test a bunch of different greek dishes, especially with a large group of people. You really can't go wrong with any

                            <p>And if you do want to drive yourself, you'll have to obtain an International Driving Permit beforehand.</p>
                        <li>Most hotels are located outside of the downtown area (and they're cheaper too!)</li>
                        <li>The islands are big on using cash, so make sure to withdraw plenty before your trip.</li>
                        <li>The summer season (June-August) is by far the best time to visit weather-wise, but that also means those months attract 
                            the most tourists.</li>
                        <li>Make sure to bring comfortable shoes! You'll be doing a lot of walking and the streets can be quite steep.</li>
                        <li>The locals are all very much used to tourists, so almost everyone I encountered spoke and understood English.</li>
                            <p>However, it's always nice to learn a few common words and phrases in the native language before arriving in a foreign country.<br>
                            For example, 'efharisto' means 'thank you' in Greek.</p>

                    Croatia was a country like no other that I had visited in Europe before. Unlike many other fan-favorite European hotspots, 
                    Croatia was only starting to gain popularity as a tourist destination when I had visited with my family in 2017. Without 
                    the disruption of packed crowds at every landmark, I was really able to take in all the beauty the country had to offer. It's 
                    affordable yet rich with history, culture, and natural attractions. If you're a fan of Game of Thrones, the city of 
                    Dubrovnik might look familiar to you, as it served as the main filming location for King's Landing.

                <h4>Where else to go from Dubrovik?</h4>
                <p>Ideally, 2-3 days is the perfect amount of time needed to explore Dubrovnik. That being said, if you're looking to stay 
                    in Croatia for a longer trip, there are many other cities and attractions to see while you're there.</p>

                <img class="buda_img" src="images/croatia_7.JPG" alt="View from Diocletian's Palace">
                <p>From Dubrovnik, you could easily rent a car and take the scenic route to Split. The city is known for its nice beaches and lively atmosphere.
                    Spend another day or 2 here relaxing on the beach, people watching on the Riva Promenade, and exploring Diocletian's Palace in the 
                    Old Town of Split. I also took a day trip to the gorgeous coastal city of Trogir when I visited, which is only a 35 minute drive away.

                <p class="croatia_dest">KRKA FALLS & PLITVICE LAKES</p>
                <img class="buda_img" src="images/croatia_8.JPG" alt="Krka Waterfall">
                <p>These two national parks are both famous for their majestic waterfalls. If you're coming from Split, I recommend stopping at Krka first to 
                    walk through the enchanting woodlands of the park that ultimately lead to the main waterfall, which you can actually swim right up to! You 
                    only need a few hours at Krka before heading to Plitvice Lakes. Plitvice, on the other hand, forbids swimming, but makes up for it with 
                    a vast array of remarkable trails and lakes.

                <img class="buda_img" src="images/croatia_9.JPG" alt="St. Mark's Church">
                <p>Continuing on with our driving tour of Croatia, Zagreb, the country's capital, is just another 2 hour drive from Plitvice National Park. 
                    This city offers many attractions to see, ranging from historic landmarks to modern areas with eccentric museums and fun cafes. A few 
                    must-sees include: St. Mark's Church, the Museum of Broken Relationships, Zabreb's Art Pavillion, the Croatian National Theatre, and the 
                    Lotrščak Tower.
