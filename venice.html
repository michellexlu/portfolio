                        <p>
                            I can wholeheartedly confirm that Venice is just as magical as it looks in all of the movies and photos. It is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever laid eyes on.
                            Tourists mainly visit for the canals that take the place of roads throughout the city, since the entire region is built on water. The blue water of the Adriatic Sea 
                            contrasted with the red roofs of the buildings paint a picturesque view that seems to have come straight out of a storybook. 
                            <br><br>
                            Prepare for a diet consisting mostly 
                            of pizza, pasta, and gelato, but don't worry! There are so many attractions to see that all of the walking you'll be doing around the city will work the food right off 
                            (plus it tastes so good that it's more than worth it).

                                    <div class="mustdos_p"><p>You definitely can't visit Venice without taking an iconic gondola ride through the canals. Yes, it 
                                        may be cliché, but trust me, this unique way of touring the city is well worth it. A 40-minute gondola ride costs 80 euros and 
                                        any time over will be another 40 euros/20 minutes. The cost for a ride after sunset will surge up to around 100 euros though. </p></div>

                                    <div class="mustdos_p"><p>St. Mark's Square, or Piazza San Marco in Italian, lies in the heart of Venice. It is a large open space– the biggest square in 
                                        the city actually– surrounded by 3 grand attractions: St. Mark's Basilica, Doge's Palace, and Campanile. The square is a great place to stop for  
                                        midday drinks in between touring the public buildings or a romantic dinner at night when the live music starts.

                                        breathtaking as the intricate gothic architecture of the exterior. The chamber of the Great Council is one of the most impressive 
                                        rooms in the palace, as it is a massive room decorated with paintings of previous Doges.

                                        design, which is why it's always crowded by tourists. From the top of the bridge, you'll find a remarkable view of Venice.

                                        because of all of the vibrantly colored homes, making it a great photo-op location. It takes about half an hour to reach from Venice by boat, 
                                        but the local food and fun colors make it completely worthwhile.
