                        <p>Budapest is one of the few places I've been fortunate enough to travel to twice in my life. I first discovered the beautiful 
                        city in 2015 when I took a family trip there in the summertime. The second time was about 5 years later during my study abroad experience 
                        in the wintertime, which showed me a completely different side of the city. It was as if I was visiting for the first time all over again. 
                        <br><br>
                        Budapest is famous for its long-standing history, mesmerizing architecture, natural hot springs, and dynamic night-life– all for a cheap price! The locals are 
                        all friendly and welcoming, especially in comparison to those in some other European countries.

                        <p>I stayed in a hostel–Hive Party Hostel–located on the Pest side of the Danube River, so this sample itinerary is based off where I was personally located!

                            BTW, recognize the photo above? This shot of the Parliament building from the Buda side was taken during my first trip in 2015 from the exact 
                            same angle as the first photo, which I took in 2020, just 5 years earlier in the opposite season! Just as magical though.

                                    stores are Retrock in Anker Köz and Szputnyik, which is just a 9 minute walk away. These stores transport you back in time

                                    and choose a restaurant spontaneously. We were in luck, as we stumbled upon Antré, a traditional Hungarian restaurant with 
                                    a modern twist. I ordered the duck breast and it was delicious!

                                    specialty coffee and typical brunch food. I ordered eggs benedict with a side of bacon of course. My friends and I also decided to 
                                    indulge in their bottomless mimosa deal, since we were on vacation after all.

                                    neo-Gothic architecture is one-of-a-kind. The Parliament is pretty much THE number one tourist attraction in Budapest and for good 
                                    reason.

                                    It is the biggest church in Budapest. If weather permits, you should definitely head to the top of the dome, where you'll be enchanted with 
                                    a view of the city.

                                <div class="mustdos_p"><p>This was by far one of my favorite activities from both of my Budapest trips. The city is known for its thermal baths, and 
                                    Szechenyi is the biggest, most popular one. When I first went in the summertime, the cool, indoor pools were perfect for escaping the unbearable heat 
                                    outside. When I returned during the complete opposite season, the outdoor hot springs helped us stay warm in the cold weather. Here, you'll 
                                    find yourself at peak relaxation. Buying your tickets online ahead of time will save you the trouble of waiting in line once you arrive.

                                    many. Located in the Jewish quarter, Mazel Tov is an open food hall serving Hungarian Israeli cuisine. It is decorated with 
                                    plants all around so that the space doubles as a restaurant and garden.

                                    Dubbed "the most beautiful café in the world," New York Café is definitely a stop you'll want to make. The restaurant is decorated with gold trimmings, elaborate  
                                    paintings across the ceiling, and magnificent detailing on the walls. The menu has breakfast, lunch, and dinner options, but the selection of pastries and desserts was 
                                    the most impressive. This is by far the best place to enjoy a cup of coffee and pastry while feeling like royalty.

                                    went back a second time during our 3 day stay in Budapest. Everything from the food, to the drinks, to the dessert was absolutely delicious and super 
                                    well-presented. Our favorites were the tuna niçoise salad (salad with seared tuna, quail eggs, potatoes, red onion, and cherry tomatoes) and the

                                    were built from the ruins of abandoned buildings and transformed into eclectic spaces perfect for drinking, dancing, and overall good 
                                    vibes. Each ruin bar has its own unique personality, but my favorite (where my friends and I went 3 nights in a row) was definitely Instant. It 
                                    is the largest ruin bar with over 20 rooms, each with a different theme. It definitely has more of nightclub feel, so if that's not what 
                                    you're looking for, these are a few other popular ruin bars: Szimpla Kert, Fogasház, and Anker’t.

                    <p>Hi, I'm Michelle– a 22 year old college student, adventure seeker, and food enthusiast! This blog began as a class 
                        project, and after having so much fun with sharing my travel experiences and advice, I decided to keep it up, documenting 
                        my travels as I go.
