                <p>Despite all of the amazing places I've been, my home country still remains one of my favorites. 
                    The diverse landscape of the U.S., ranging from cities to countrysides, mountaintops to beaches, and 
                    deserts to forests, allows for endless adventures and sights to see. Regardless of the time of year,
                    you could find yourself skiing down the slopes of Colorado, tanning on the sandy beaches of Florida, or
                    hiking through any of our beautiful national parks. While the U.S. has plenty of major cities and popular tourist
                    attractions to visit, there are also so many hidden gems throughout the country that offer a completely different yet 
                    equally as valuable of an experience. Not only does the U.S. house a wide variety of topographical beauty, 
                    but it is also known as a melting pot of different nationalities, cultures, and ethnicities. Everywhere you look, 
                    you will find people of unique backgrounds living together and sharing their values, traditions, and 
                    (most importantly, in my opinion) cuisines with one another.

                        <p>If you're looking for excitement, New York City (also known as the "City that Never Sleeps") is the place for you! 
                            It's the most populous city in the U.S., where the streets are constantly bustling with people no matter the hour of day. 
                            NYC serves as the heart of art, fashion, food, and commerce, giving everyone something to do. One of my favorite spots in 
                            the city is the newly built Vessel located in Hudson Yards. Its unique architecture, composed of a spiral staircase with 
                            approximately 2,500 steps, and breathtaking view of the city from the top of the structure attracts visitors from all over the world.

                        <h4>Take a Tropical Vacation to Hawaii!</h4>
                        <p>Hawaii is famous for its colorful beaches, natural beauty, and plethora of outdoor activities. I visited the 3 islands of Big Island, Oahu, 
                            and Maui- each with its own unique charm. I would suggest all nature lovers to put Big Island on their bucket list ASAP, as 
                            it was hard to believe that the incredible volcanos, rainforests, and cliffs before my eyes were truly real life.
                            In a quick 180, Oahu radiated a lively city atmosphere with crowded beaches, luxury shopping, and exciting nightlife. Honolulu, the capital city, is 
                            located on Oahu; however, that doesn't mean that you won't still be surrounded by plenty of natural attractions. Lastly, Maui lies in the 
                            middleground of the other two. It offers a calmer vibe than Oahu, yet the small beach towns of Maui provide better insight into the people 
                            and local cultures than does Big Island.

                        <h4>Spend a Summer in Martha's Vineyard!</h4>
                        <p>If you find yourself on the East Coast, you won't regret paying a visit to the beautifiul Island of Martha's Vineyard. 
                            There's a reason why many of your favorite celebrities flock here for the summer, including the Obamas, Clintons, 
                            and Kennedys among many others. The island is comprised of 6 towns: Edgartown, Oak Bluffs, Vineyard Haven, West Tisbury, 
                            Aquinnah, and Chilmark. The photo of the lighthouse above was taken during my high school senior trip in 2017, where we spent a weekend enjoying 
                            lobster rolls in Oak Bluffs, watching sunsets on Menemsha Beach in Chilmark, and catching the sunrise on the beaches of 
                            Edgartown. Since then, I have made multiple trips back every summer– I just can't stay away!

                        <h4>Take a Weekend Trip to Downtown Boston!</h4>
                        <p>Of course, it's only appropriate for me to boast about my hometown as a must-see. Walking down the cobblestone streets of Boston will instantly transport you 
                            back in history, which earns it the reputation as one of America's most historic cities. I grew up in a suburb outside 
                            of Boston, and my favorite weekend activity would be getting on the MBTA train to spend a day in the city. My summer days consisted of 
                            shopping on Newbury Street, kayaking in the Charles River, and picniking while people-watching in Boston Common. 
                            In the wintertime, I have many fond memories of my parents taking me to watch the planetarium show at the Museum of Science or ice 
                            skate at the Boston Common Frog Pond, and we would always end our day with delicious food from Faneuil Hall Marketplace. This city 
                            has fun activities to offer all visitors both young and old.

                <p>Canada is home to 10 provinces and 3 territories. Out of those, I've only been able to visit Ontario and Quebec but hope to expand my 
                    travels throughout the country, especially out West. If you're a foodie like I am, I highly recommend taking a trip to the city of 
                    Toronto. In my humble opinion, I think it offers some of the most delicious and authentic Chinese food you can find outside of China.

            <div class="visited">
              <p>Mexico is a great destination in North America for anyone who's looking for a relaxing beach vacation. Many tourists 
                choose to stay in a resort, which typically includes beach access, an assortment of delicious food, and refreshing drinks– what 
                more could you ask for! Personally, I have taken a family vacation in Cancun and a trip with friends to Cabo San Lucas. The white sand beaches in 
                Cancun were unbeatable, while the water activities and festive nightlife in Cabo made for an exciting and unforgettable visit. When in 
                Cancun, be sure to take a day trip to see the archeological site of Chichén Itzá, a beautiful complex of ancient Mayan ruins. </p>
