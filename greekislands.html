                            Every travel agency website is bound to display an image of the iconic blue-domed, white-wallled villages of the Greek islands. 
                            If a chance to see this spectacular scenery in person isn't enough of a reason to make a trip, then the food and beaches will 
                            surely convince you. 
                            <br><br>
                            I've had the chance to visit Mykonos and Santorini, which are the 2 most popular islands among the hundreds 
                            of inhabited islands belonging to Greece. While the two share many physical similarities, they radiate completely different 
                            ambiances. Mykonos is famous for its upbeat and upscale scene; whereas, Santorini has a more relaxed and romantic atmosphere. 
                            I'm beyond grateful for having had the opportunity to get a taste of both the rowdy and serene sides to the Greek islands.

                        <p>We started off our trip by flying into Athens, spending a few days there (for which you can find the itinerary on a different page), and then taking a 
                            high-speed 2 hour ferry to Mykonos Port.

                                        Greece is that stopping along the side of any street will make for a picturesque photo-op. I loved posing with the pink and purple flowers 
                                        that contrasted the white buildings in the background.

                                    <div class="mustdos_p"><p>Little Venice is a strip of the island named after the Italian city because of its Venetian-inspired buildings and 
                                        waterfront view. It's a quaint, romantic neighborhood, where you can find lots of bars and restaurants. This area is also one of the best 
                                        sunset spots in Mykonos, so be sure to reserve a night for dinner and a view!

                                <li>Go island hopping from Mykonos to the nearby Cycladic islands.</li>
                                    <div class="mustdos_p"><p>The central location of Mykonos makes it the perfect starting point for a day of island-hopping to see some of the smaller Greek 
                                        islands. We ended up staying on one of the islands and renting a beach cabana for the day- so relaxing!

                                    <div class="mustdos_p"><p>It serves authentic Mediterranean cuisine and is tucked away on a busy side street. We were seated under the vine-covered verandah, 
                                        and it was the perfect place to dine and people watch at the same time.

                                        and art galleries in the area that I recommend wandering through to gain a deeper understanding of Greek culture and history.</p></div>

                                    <div class="mustdos_p"><p>Sitting at the top of Oia Castle and watching the sunset was a surreal moment for me. The orange and pink skies complimented the whitewashed 
                                        buildings perfectly, and you even get a view of the windmills in the distance. The crowd starts forming way before the sun sets, so I 
                                        suggest getting there early to secure a good spot.

                                        edition books, and the walls are covered in famous book quotes, posters, and murals. You may even find a few cats perched on top 
                                        of a stack of books in an attempt to escape the heat.

                                        to taste test a bunch of different greek dishes, especially with a large group of people. You really can't go wrong with any 
                                        of the spreads, seafood, or meats.

                                <li>The summer season (June-August) is by far the best time to visit weather-wise, but that also means those months attract 
                                    the most tourists.</li>
                                <li>Make sure to bring comfortable shoes! You'll be doing a lot of walking and the streets can be quite steep.</li>
                                <li>The locals are all very much used to tourists, so almost everyone I encountered spoke and understood English.</li>
